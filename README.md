# Admin Panel â€“ Laravel 12
This is the Admin Panel for an eCommerce food ordering platform built with Laravel 12. It provides backend management features including CRUD operations for products, categories, coupons, orders, content pages, and more. The panel is built to work alongside a customer-facing website.

**Note:** The frontend assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Alpine.js, etc.) were pre-built and **not developed by me.** This project focuses exclusively on Laravel backend development and integration with the frontend.

## Features
- Admin authentication and access control.

- Order management.
- Jalali date support via morilog/jalali.
